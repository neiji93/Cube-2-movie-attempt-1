# Cube-2-movie-attempt-1
Liké a Dream, due to m'y illness, i encounter a tesseract that bottom lignes are thé last to bé drawn.accordi'g to nano ottoseconds in brain surgery, this IS possible. I maybbe wrong.
the left corner must appear before bottom lined 
if there id a possibllity to have programs running inside ghe tesseract, thie may be dchedulled by the scheduller here : https://github.com/neiji93/ImSecondHouston--ISH-OS.git
may be absolutely maybe wrong.
then it means we cannot have a server at thr moment ans then it means we must stay i' the same room at the start like the movie suggests it.
i thought previously zbout 4 groups of 2 processes running on a computer.
